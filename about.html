Hi! My name is Lauren Brady, the creator of this website. Perhaps you've had a chance to browse through some of my work. If not, you're looking at it right now!
</p>      
<p>
I made this website in my creative computing course at Parsons the New School. I am currently studying communications design there and am really loving it. Making things, whether it be in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premeire Pro or even HTML and CSS, is one of my favourite things to do. 
</p>
<p>
In my spare time, I really enjoy exercise and the outdoors. I love to run, ski, hike, bike and practice yoga. Anything that will bring me closer to nature. This may seem a bit odd living in New York City, but I actually really like it here. It's nice being busy and surrounded by people all the time. Plus, the food is unbeleivable. I spend most of my time in coffee shops and restaurants, admiring the interior design, branding, and of course the food. Vegetables are my favourite. 
</p>
<p>
You might have noticed I spell the word "favourite" with an "ou". This is because I'm from Canada. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for visiting my website, I hope you enjoy it!
